## The Problem
Retail investors are sick and tired of being played like a fiddle by Wall Street.

## The Premise
Recently, the stock market has shown unprecedented levels of volatility created by both hedge fund managers and the common person alike. 

Because of events like this, retail investors have both gained and losts thousands of dollars due to events of market manipulation and illegal speculation by large banks, investment firms, and market makers.

That's where [**WeHedge**](https://wehedge.app) comes in.

WeHedge is an app designed to turn you and others (could be your friends, could be randos on the internet) into an investment bloc. Your investments could potentially have meaning and adjust the market in your favor.

Users have the option to join as many groups as they wish, and release a chosen amount of money into a group's pool. The group then publicly votes on how the money will be invested and when the money should be pulled out of the market. 
Once the money is tied in, it cannot be withdrawn until a sell stop order is met. 

In essence, WeHedge is the first of its kind in democratic portfolio management.

We love democracy.
